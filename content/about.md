B.S Computer Science and B.A Mathematics ‘17 from The University at Buffalo

I don’t like cold places

I enjoy learning new things, creating github repos and enlightening people about the wonders of Mechanical Keyboards

Currently dipping my toes into technical blogging, and learning Rust, Go & TypeScript.
