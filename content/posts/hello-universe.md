![Black Hole](/images/blackhole.jpg)

## A blog? Is this 2012? Why are you making one?

These are all questions that no one asked me when I told them that I was gonna make a blog, but I figured that it was only responsible of me to answer them anyway.

Reasons to have a blog:

* Everyone and their mothers have one
* It gives me a space to write down thoughts, musings, tutorials and anything else I can think of
* It's *cool*?

So yeah, this is my blog. Hopefully you find this just as amusing and useful as I do.

*PS: This was totally not a contrived excuse to post a random image of the black hole from Interstellar*
